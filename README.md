# HIJIBIJI

Hijibiji is a Bangla word which translates to 'randomly'. This `hijibiji` package creates random things. By things I mean random video, random audio, random image, random points etc. I don't have any idea if this has some real life application. The motivation to create this package came to me when I was random walking in streets of my university campus. So, yeah, here it is. 

## What it generates

Using the `rand_image()` function of the package images of any dimension with random pixel values can be generated.
